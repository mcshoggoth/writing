# The Bones of Place

## Exercise

### Part A

Choose a place you know well, preferably a space larger than a house, apartment bldng, etc. and preferably "outside." Think in terms of city blocks, pieces of land, parks and other recreation areas, driving routes/stretches of road, bodies of water and the marginal lands around them, places you find yourself at certain times of the year. Try to stay general! The only rule is to WRITE IN THE PRESENT TENSE.

- What do you notice about it that you suspect others overlook?
- What does *everyone* notice about it?
- What are the sights, sounds, smells, textures, and tastes as you have known them?
- What would someone experiencing it for the very first time notice?
- What would *you* like this "someone" to know about the place?

Write 5-10 lines/sentences/statements in response:

### response

- Lack of trees, constant Semi Truck traffic
- small, brick buildings, old part of town
- old run down buildings, depressed economy, smells like exhaust, far off sounds of school bands, or cheer leading, or student voices, the taste of pizza and coffee, 
- How small the town is, the disparity between the campus and the town
- This small town is not great

### Part B

What is a specific memory or experience you associate with this place? Do your best to summon it, remember it in detail. Write an equal (and only equal!) number of lines/sentences/statements as Part A. Write in the ***PAST TENSE***.
