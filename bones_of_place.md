# The Bones of Place

## Exercise
{
### Part A

Choose a place you know well, preferably a space larger than a house, apartment bldng, etc. and preferably "outside." Think in terms of city blocks, pieces of land, parks and other recreation areas, driving routes/stretches of road, bodies of water and the marginal lands around them, places you find yourself at certain times of the year. Try to stay general! The only rule is to WRITE IN THE PRESENT TENSE.

- What do you notice about it that you suspect others overlook?
- What does *everyone* notice about it?
- What are the sights, sounds, smells, textures, and tastes as you have known them?
- What would someone experiencing it for the very first time notice?
- What would *you* like this "someone" to know about the place?

Write 5-10 lines/sentences/statements in response:

(2) - Lack of trees, constant Semi Truck traffic
- small, brick buildings, old part of town
- old run down buildings, depressed economy, smells like exhaust, far off sounds of school bands, or cheer leading, or student voices, the taste of pizza and coffee, 
- How small the town is, the disparity between the campus and the town
- This small town is not great

### Part B

What is a specific memory or experience you associate with this place? Do your best to summon it, remember it in detail. Write an equal (and only equal!) number of lines/sentences/statements as Part A. Write in the ***PAST TENSE***.

It was spring, junior year of college.  I walked through the manicured campus with my Colorado Rockie's purple, black, and white, jacket on. It was raining. The jack was not as waterproof as I thought it would be.

The campus was devoid of life. Some sports event drew the interest of most of the campus.

I walked, and as I walked I felt: melancholia, alone, isolated, the weight of significance of life.
I enjoyed those feelings, but also wished I could share them with someone. It is hard to share isolation with another person.
the feeling of being "just me against the world" could also easily be "just us against the world" but if you add too many people it turns into "the world against a few" and you get lost in the void of a crowd.

This feeling, I craved it. It was so hard to grab hold of.  It's the feeling of the world when it is empty. Halloween when you are alone. Christmas on your own, Thanksgiving, times of gathering where you have no one to gather with.  It is dissapointing, in such times, to actually meet another person.

(1) I returned, soaked, to my brick building, past the empty rooms.

### Part C

Now we shuffle. ***Make a mess***

What happens when the tenses mix? What if the whole MESS shifts into complete past or complete present? Place can only and ever reflect TIME! What do you make of time? What does it say to you about your sense of place, of WHERE? Answering this question requires a lifetime of dedicated creative exploration, and even then...


Last line of part b, first line of part a, second to last line of part b, second line of part a, etc.
