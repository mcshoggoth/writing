# Name

The new religion is not new.
It is old, broken, wrinkled, dying.
Its name is "Kosmos".
This is the name we do not know, but worship.
This name is hollow. 
It demands sacrifice.
Not a burnt offering from your storehouse
Not a goat from your yard.
Just keep doing what you're doing
Live your life the way you want
That's all the sacrifice the hidden word will need
