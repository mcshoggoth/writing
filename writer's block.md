# Write about writer's block

I'm not going to be able to write anything good.  What point is there, no one wants to here what i have to say.

it's too late to make a mark, to write anything people want to hear or understand.  
I don't know the current culture enough to write anything good.

	"Writing about writer's block is better than not writing at all." ~ Charles Bukowski

When you can't make progress in writing, write about the process of writing instead. just write about anything. 
Nick Cave: "There She Goes My Beautiful World" - about writer's block, muse, etc.
