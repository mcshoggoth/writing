# Write about writer's block

I'm not going to be able to write anything good.  What point is there, no one wants to hear what i have to say.

it's too late to make a mark, to write anything people want to hear or understand.  
I don't know the current culture enough to write anything good.

	"Writing about writer's block is better than not writing at all." ~ Charles Bukowski

When you can't make progress in writing, write about the process of writing instead. just write about anything. 
Nick Cave: "There She Goes My Beautiful World" - about writer's block, muse, etc.

# A Break from the main thing you're working on

## Writing about something interesting rather than the work you are doing right now
- Take a break from that point in the product / work
- Take a break from the product / work itself

something, maybe in flash fiction. actually, that doesn't matter.  the finished product will determine style of fiction.

Not sure what to write about. I know i have a certain feeling about fear, and horror, and
supernatural, but I have a hard time using that.

what kind of horror do i want to write about?  The unexplainable, the mysterious, the inhuman
perhaps, or things that aren't what they seem.

# Abstract Concepts - to write about them

## Trying to bring abstraction to life
- rendering abstract words in concrete details
	- racism, injustice, evil, ambition, growing old, salvation, poverty, growing up, sexual deceit,
	  wealth
	- "What is \_\_\_\_\_?"

### Evil
	1. Evil is Jeffrey Dahmer
	2. Evil is Serial Killers
	3. Evil is Child Molesters
	4. Evil is not keeping your promises

### Poverty
	1. Poverty is dying of hunger
	2. Poverty is sorrow
	3. Poverty is death
	4. Poverty is the bad smelling man on the bus next to me

### Horror
	1. Horror is the night when it sounds like the door opened
	2. Horror is hearing someone upstairs only to realize that you're alone
	3. Horror is the doorbell ringing and no one is there
	4. Horror is an empty slot in the kitchen knife-block

# Every word in the story has to be one syllable

They went to a film. The name was "The Dead Thing." They were glad and scared at the same time.
That night, in bed, while they slept, there was a sound. Like nails on wood. In his dreams, he saw
shards of wood in skin. Nails on top. Smears of blood.
His foot struck out, she woke up and heard the sound.
~
When he woke, in the sun, he did not find her in bed. The sheets were a mess. He went down the
stairs, to the table. the back door was open. she was gone.

# Overly flowery language/words

After the police left, after the CSI nerds had completed their task of finding and cataloging

# Minor character with Major cacophany

Before fred died, on the plain, he slept. He felt very tired and uncomfortable. It felt to him like
his skin was rolling, vibrating. He felt a pressure in his chest. He was too young for a heart
attack, perhaps it's a panic attack. He did feel panicked after seeing things on the path. That
black swarm coming toward him
