# Write about writer's block

I'm not going to be able to write anything good.  What point is there, no one wants to hear what i have to say.

it's too late to make a mark, to write anything people want to hear or understand.  
I don't know the current culture enough to write anything good.

	"Writing about writer's block is better than not writing at all." ~ Charles Bukowski

When you can't make progress in writing, write about the process of writing instead. just write about anything. 
Nick Cave: "There She Goes My Beautiful World" - about writer's block, muse, etc.

# A Break from the main thing you're working on

## Writing about something interesting rather than the work you are doing right now
- Take a break from that point in the product / work
- Take a break from the product / work itself

something, maybe in flash fiction. actually, that doesn't matter.  the finished product will determine style of fiction.

Not sure what to write about. I know i have a certain feeling about fear, and horror, and
supernatural, but I have a hard time using that.

what kind of horror do i want to write about?  The unexplainable, the mysterious, the inhuman
perhaps, or things that aren't what they seem.
