# Lay's Stax

LAY'S STAX ~~are the ultimate way to recharge~~ *is the new religion*.

LAY's STAX Mesquite BBQ flavored potato crisps ~~give you the full flavor and crispy crunch that adds great taste to your busy day~~ *will be your new Messiah.*

~~Enjoy~~ *Love, with all your heart* LAY'S STAX crisps*.* ~~at the office, around the house or wherever you are!~~ *Love them and pray that they deal mercifully with you!*

## replace adjectives with different adjectives that you want.

LAY's STAX are the *heretical* way to recharge.

LAY's STAX *salted cardboard* flavored potato crisps give you the *fucking awesome* flavor and *super exciting* crunch that adds *all of the* taste to your *normally drab* day.



## take the new lines, cross out what's not working, whatever is left is the start of the new line.

The new religion,

Flavored potato crisps, will be your new Messiah.

Pray that they deal mercifully with you!

# Favorite line, favorite image, that is now the basis for the new poem
