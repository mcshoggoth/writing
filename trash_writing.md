# Favorite line, favorite image, that is now the basis for the new poem

***First Attempt***

The new religion is not new.
It is old, broken, wrinkled, dying.
It's name is "Kosmos".
This is the name we do not know, but worship.
This name is hollow. 
It demands sacrifice.
Not a burnt offering from your storehouse
Not a goat from your yard.
It demands you and your life
Don't worry, you won't notice.
