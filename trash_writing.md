# Favorite line, favorite image, that is now the basis for the new poem

***First Attempt***

The new religion is not actually new.
It is the same as it ever was.
It's name is "Materialism", or "Mammon", or "Kosmos".
These are old and new names.
One day they will be forgotten as will the new religion.
